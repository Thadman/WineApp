# R7 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.

Whilst thinking about implementing an app for this assignment , i wanted to help solve the problem that wine drinkers often have with their wines and keeping notes/description of the wines they have drunken and what they thought of the the particular wine and what the details of the specific wine were. I have had discussions with wine enthusiasts who have mentioned this and said that they kept notes, but mainly on Microsoft Excel, with no pictures and did not have the means to have it displayed in a manner that was more aesthetically pleasing. I ended up designing and implementing an app that adhered to this. I did not want, or did not implement a counter of each particular wine (something i can do in the future potentially) as i felt that the wine notes only applied to the singular bottle. 

# R8 Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Through the design process of this application , i was asking my Dad questions related to this ( he is a wine nut - has ~1000 bottles stored in the house, and all on excel!), and thought he would appreciate the ability to use an application in which he could store his wines, and keep a note about them, regarding tasting notes, a description about the wine, and the standard attributes that a wine has - its alcohol content, grape variety (sometimes there is more than one, i also kept this limited as there are roughly 10,000 grape varieties), a wine type, which i had to narrow down to just 5 for useability purposes, the size of the wine, and of course the price and a picture of the bottle.

# R11 Description of your marketplace app (website)

Purpose  - The purpose of this app is to help wine enthusiasts keep a log of the wines they have been drinking and keeping a note about them, regarding the tasting notes and keeping track of the other attributes that the particular wine has, a way in which they can look back on the wine and reminisce and have their memory jogged as to what the wine tasted like , and what they had paired the wine with. 
Functionality / features - The functionality of this application is rather simple, a user can sign up to the website and they are granted an account/profile. They can look through wines that have been listed by other users and add to the collection themselves. They can also then edit their listing, and god forbid anything unbelievable happens, they are also granted the god like authority of even deleting their own listed wine, which is possible to see in their profile, or in fact 'not' see in their profile anymore. Under the extremely unlikely circumstances they want nothing more to do with the application, they are also lucky enough ( or unlucky enough ) to delete their very own account. The user is also able to search the whole list of wines by name and view a particular wine, and then view this by itself , and here it is in fact their wine are also able to edit or delete it here as well. The website application has multiple features. This includes a navbar in which they can navigate the site through, a search bar in which the user can search for wines by name. A page in which they can register to the website, as well as a page that they can login. The site has a listings page in which the user can view all the wine listings that have been posted there. They also have the opportunity to 'view' the wines through a 'show' page, which contains just the wine itself with more details about the wine. The site also has user profiles in which the user can see the wines they have uploaded. they can also go to the show page from here as well. Another feature that i have implemented was a search bar for the wines, after searching you are taken to a page revealing the results of the search and you are able to click on the name of the wine and are taken to the show page again. The user also has the ability to view the pages by clicking next/previous, allowing for 6 listings per page to minimize scrolling for UX. The website also has the ability to return to the homepage at any stage with the brand in the top-right corner, using it as a link to the homepage. 
Target Audience - The target audience for this web application is anyone who has a vested interest in wine and wants to keep track of their experience of each wine and keep i detail what they thought of it. It is not catered to people younger than 18 of course ! 
Tech Stack - The tech stack i used for this application was Ruby and Ruby on Rails framework. I used Bootstrap for the front end, and CSS3 and HTML5. I used Heroku to deploy the application. For image upload i used an AWS  S3 bucket.
